    "### **Context & Rationale**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accurate rainfall prediction plays a pivotal role across various sectors, including agriculture, disaster preparedness, and urban planning. In agriculture, timely and precise forecasts are essential to avoid crop losses, while in urban planning, accurate predictions help mitigate the risk of flooding and infrastructure damage. Additionally, accurate rainfall predictions support disaster preparedness by allowing authorities to take proactive measures, reducing economic and social disruptions. \n",
